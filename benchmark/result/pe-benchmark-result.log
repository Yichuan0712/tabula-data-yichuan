Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables:

[[70]]

The two tables have significant differences:

1. Table 2 is missing many rows compared to Table 1. Table 1 has 110 rows while Table 2 only has 105 rows. The missing rows reduce the similarity score significantly.

2. The Characteristic/risk factor column in Table 2 contains different information than in Table 1. Table 2 has entries like "Failure (nonresponders)", "Success MBP-OP at", "Delayed failure", etc. which are not present in Table 1. This indicates the data is not mapped to the correct columns.

3. The Statistic column in Table 2 contains entries like "Two-way analysis of variance for repeated measurements" and "Fisher's exact test" which are not summary statistics. Based on the column definition, the Statistic column should not contain this type of information. 

4. Table 2 is missing the % symbol in the Value column for percentage values.

5. Table 2 has many rows where the Interval low and Interval high columns contain inequality symbols like < and >, while Table 1 does not use inequality symbols in these columns.

6. Table 2 uses the term "beats per min" in the Unit column while Table 1 uses "Beats per min". While these refer to the same unit, the inconsistency reduces the similarity score slightly.

In summary, while the two tables contain some overlapping information, the numerous differences in data mapping, missing rows, and inconsistencies in following the column definitions result in a similarity score of 70 out of 100. The tables would need significant reformatting and cleanup to be considered highly similar.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables:

[[70]]

The two tables have a moderate level of similarity, with some key differences:

1. Table 2 is missing the "NA" values present in the Characteristic/risk factor column of Table 1. This makes it harder to directly compare rows between the tables.

2. Table 2 contains additional rows at the beginning with age, weight, RACHS-1 score, baseline creatinine, baseline SAP, CPB time, cross-clamp time, and DHCA time data that are not present in Table 1. 

3. The exposure groups are labeled slightly differently between the tables ("Fenoldopam" vs "Patients received fenoldopam", "Control" vs "Patients in control group").

4. Table 2 contains the unit "None" for the inotropic score, while Table 1 uses "Number". 

5. The p-values are missing for many rows in Table 1 but are present for all rows in Table 2.

6. The order of the outcome measures differs between the tables.

However, the core data on hemodynamic parameters and electrolyte levels is quite consistent between the two tables when comparing the matching Fenoldopam and Control groups. The values, units, and variability measures align well.

In summary, while there are some structural and labeling differences, the key clinical data is moderately similar between the two tables. The additional baseline data in Table 2 provides useful context not available in Table 1. But the missing "NA" labels and ordering differences reduce the overall similarity to a score of 70 out of 100.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables, using Table 1 as the standard:

Differences:
1. Table 2 is missing the "Variability statistic", "Variability value", "Interval type", "Interval low", and "Interval high" columns compared to Table 1.
2. Table 2 has additional rows for p-values, which are not present in Table 1.
3. The "Characteristic/risk factor" and "Exposure" columns in Table 2 are merged into the "Outcomes" column.
4. The data in Table 2 is not well-organized according to the column definitions. For example, the "Value" column contains both frequency and percentage values.
5. Table 2 uses abbreviations for drug names (CBZ, VPA, LEV), while Table 1 uses full names (Levetiracetam, Valproate).
6. The outcomes in Table 2 are not as detailed as in Table 1, e.g., "Patients with complete disappearance of hypsarrhythmia" vs. "EEG response - complete disappearance".
7. The p-values in Table 2 are in a separate row, while in Table 1, they are in the same row as the corresponding data.

Similarities:
1. Both tables contain information about seizure response and EEG response to different drugs in children with rolandic epilepsy.
2. The drugs mentioned in both tables are the same (Levetiracetam, Valproate, Carbamazepine).
3. The outcomes measured (seizure-free, 50% reduction of seizures, total responder, EEG response, duration of response) are similar in both tables.
4. The "Statistic", "Value", and "Unit" columns are present in both tables.

Considering the significant differences in the structure, organization, and level of detail between the two tables, I would assign a similarity score of:

[[35]]

The score is relatively low due to the missing columns, inconsistent data placement, and lack of detailed outcomes in Table 2 compared to Table 1.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables:

The tables have some overlap in the characteristics and outcomes reported, but there are also significant differences:

Similarities:
- Both tables report on patients receiving methylprednisolone vs placebo
- Several of the same outcomes are reported including STAT mortality risk categories, CPB duration, aortic cross clamp duration, use of DHCA, DHCA duration, and use of modified ultrafiltration
- The values, units, and variability statistics align for the overlapping outcomes

Differences: 
- Table 2 contains many additional patient characteristics not found in Table 1, such as gestational age, sex, race, ethnicity, age at surgery, weight at surgery, and more granular procedure/diagnosis categories
- Table 1 is missing several of the outcomes reported in Table 2
- The row order and total number of rows differs significantly between the tables
- Table 2 reports p-values for comparisons between the methylprednisolone and placebo groups for some outcomes, while Table 1 only reports them sporadically
- Some terminology differs, e.g. "USE of DHCA" in Table 1 vs "Use of DHCA" in Table 2, "DCHA duration" vs "DHCA duration"

Given the significant differences in the number of characteristics and outcomes reported, as well as the inconsistencies in reporting p-values and some terminology, I would assess the overall similarity of these tables as:

[[55]]

The tables report on the same groups and share some key outcomes, but differ substantially in scope and granularity. Aligning the shared elements requires carefully mapping outcomes between the two tables.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables:

The tables have a high degree of overlap in the parameters reported, including blood loss, need for uterotonic agents, hemoglobin levels, blood pressure, pulse rate, and drug side effects. The exposures (tranexamic acid and control) and units are consistent between the tables.

However, there are several key differences:

1. Table 2 is missing rows for abortion, duration of third stage of labor, BP/PR/Hb before delivery that are present in Table 1. 

2. Table 2 reports some outcomes differently, such as "Drug side effect during the first 24 h No" instead of "No Drug side effect during the first 24 h". The side effects are also formatted differently with line breaks.

3. The statistics column in Table 2 uses formats like "meanÂ±SD" and "n (%)" which don't match the "mean" and "Frequency" used in Table 1. 

4. Table 2 is missing p-values for many rows that are present in Table 1.

5. Some of the values are formatted differently between the tables, like "-93.30%" vs "93.3".

6. Table 2 appears to have the exposure groups in separate rows for each outcome, while Table 1 keeps them in the exposure column.

Given the high overlap in parameters but differences in formatting and some missing data, I would assess the similarity as:

[[70]]

The tables report mostly the same information but have enough structural and formatting differences to not be considered highly similar. Standardizing the formatting and ensuring all parameters are present in both tables would increase the similarity score.

Here are the key differences between the two tables:

1. Table 1 focuses specifically on quetiapine exposure and its associated outcomes, while Table 2 covers a broader range of atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone) and their effects on infants exposed through breastfeeding.

2. Table 1 reports the frequency of specific outcomes (exposed while breastfeeding, delay in motor and mental milestones) in terms of the number of patients affected. In contrast, Table 2 provides both the frequency and percentage of infants experiencing various side effects (rash, sedation, diarrhea, constipation, excessive cry, jitteriness).

3. Table 2 includes additional information on the effects of olanzapine and risperidone exposure on infant weight, height, and DASII scores, which is not present in Table 1.

4. The structure and formatting of the two tables differ significantly. Table 1 has a more concise structure with fewer rows and columns, while Table 2 has a more extensive layout with multiple rows for each outcome and additional columns for interval type, interval low, and interval high values.

5. Table 2 has several rows with missing or incomplete data (e.g., rows 12-23), which reduces the overall similarity between the two tables.

Considering these differences and the provided guidelines, the similarity score between Table 1 and Table 2 is:

[[30]]

The low similarity score is primarily due to the significant differences in the scope of the exposures and outcomes reported, the structure and formatting of the tables, and the presence of missing or incomplete data in Table 2.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables:

The tables have some overlap in the "Progression risk factor analysis for spherical equivalent more than â 0.50 diopters" section, but there are significant differences overall:

- Table 1 contains data on changes in ophthalmic parameters after 1 year of atropine 0.01% treatment, which is completely absent from Table 2. This makes up the majority of Table 1.

- Table 2 contains additional risk factor data not present in Table 1, such as age, gender, and iris color. 

- The risk factor odds ratios common between the tables (previous year progression, spherical equivalent, axial length, anterior chamber, pupil size) have the same values. However, Table 2 contains an additional "Residual" variability statistic for each that is not present in Table 1.

- Table 1 is missing the "Residual" variability statistic data present in Table 2. Conversely, Table 2 is missing all the baseline, 12-month, and change data that makes up most of Table 1.

- The column labels are the same between the tables. The data is mapped to the correct columns in both.

In summary, while there is a small amount of overlapping data between the risk factor odds ratios, the two tables cover substantially different information overall. Table 1 focuses mainly on atropine treatment outcomes, while Table 2 focuses on additional progression risk factors. Based on the large amount of non-overlapping data and the presence/absence of certain statistics between the tables, I would assess the similarity as:

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables, using Table 1 as the standard:

Differences:
1. Table 2 is missing many of the characteristics/risk factors and outcomes present in Table 1, such as antenatal steroid use, cesarean section, maternal hypertension, gestational diabetes, Apgar scores, RDS surfactant use, patent ductus arteriosus treatment, and many others. This significantly reduces the similarity score.

2. Table 2 uses different terminology for some outcomes compared to Table 1. For example, "Thinning of the corpus callosum" vs "Tinning of the corpus callosum", and "dilated lateral ventricles" vs "Dilated lateral ventricles". 

3. The summary statistics used are different between the tables. Table 1 primarily uses medians and percentages, while Table 2 uses "None" for many of the summary statistic cells.

4. The variation statistics are different. Table 1 uses interquartile ranges, while Table 2 uses ranges.

5. Some data in Table 2 seems to be in the wrong columns. For example, rows 55-94 have data in the "Value" column that looks like it should be in the "Interval low" and "Interval high" columns based on the header definitions.

Similarities:
1. Both tables are comparing outcomes based on exposure to morphine in very preterm infants.

2. Many of the brain abnormality outcomes are the same between the tables, such as focal signal abnormality, thinning of the corpus callosum, dilated lateral ventricles, volume reduction, etc.

3. The exposure groups (morphine exposure vs no exposure) are the same.

4. The statistics used (adjusted relative risk, median, percent) are largely the same, although used inconsistently in Table 2.

Based on the significant differences in included characteristics/risk factors and outcomes, the inconsistencies in data entry in Table 2, and the differences in summary and variation statistics used, I would give these tables a similarity score of:

[[35]]

The tables are looking at a similar clinical question in a similar population, but the execution and completeness are quite different between the two tables, leading to a low similarity score when using Table 1 as the reference standard.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables, using Table 1 as the standard:

Differences:
1. Table 2 is missing the "Trachomatous inflammation - follicular prevalence" outcome that is present in Table 1. Instead, Table 2 contains demographic characteristics of the study population.
2. Table 2 does not have any data for the "Interval low", "Interval high", and "P value" columns that are present in Table 1.
3. The "Statistic" column in Table 2 contains "mean" values, while Table 1 has "Percent" and "Incidence rate ratio".
4. Table 2 has additional columns for "Variability statistic" and "Variability value" that are not present in Table 1.
5. The exposures and characteristics/risk factors are different between the two tables.

Similarities:
1. Both tables have data for the "Azithromycin" and "Placebo" exposure groups.
2. The "Unit" column is present in both tables, although it is not populated in Table 1.
3. Both tables have a "Value" column.

Based on the significant differences in the outcomes, statistics, and overall structure of the two tables, I would assign a similarity score of:

[[25]]

The tables have some overlap in the exposure groups and a few common columns, but the majority of the data and structure is different. Table 2 appears to be presenting baseline demographic characteristics of the study population, while Table 1 is focused on the trachoma prevalence outcomes at baseline and 24 months.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables, using Table 1 as the standard:

Similarity Score: [[50]]

Key Differences:
1. Table 2 is missing many of the exposures and outcomes present in Table 1, such as Apgar scores, cardiac massage at delivery, drugs for resuscitation, intubation at delivery, postnatal age at initiation of postnatal corticosteroid, duration of treatment, and respiratory support details.

2. Table 2 includes additional exposures and outcomes not present in Table 1, such as birth weight, male sex, total length of stay, total days of mechanical ventilation, days to extubation after PNC administered, survival to discharge, BPD status, treated retinopathy of prematurity, severe NEC, GI perforation, and brain injury on imaging.

3. The structure and formatting of the two tables are quite different. Table 1 has a consistent format with each row representing a specific exposure-outcome combination, while Table 2 has a more complex structure with multiple levels of exposures and outcomes.

4. Some of the data in Table 2 appears to be in the wrong columns based on the column definitions provided. For example, the "Interval type" column contains data that should be in the "Variability statistic" column (e.g., IQR).

5. Table 2 uses different terminology for some exposures and outcomes compared to Table 1 (e.g., "Postnatal steroids for BPD" vs. specific drug names like dexamethasone and hydrocortisone).

6. Table 2 includes data for different gestational age groups (<32 weeks and <27 weeks) that are not present in Table 1.

Given these significant differences in structure, content, and formatting, I have assigned a similarity score of 50 out of 100. The two tables cover some of the same exposures and outcomes related to postnatal corticosteroid use, but there are many discrepancies that limit their overall similarity.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables:

[[65]]

The two tables have some similarities but also significant differences:

Similarities:
- Both tables contain data on vasopressor therapy with dopamine and epinephrine in neonates
- Many of the same parameters are reported, such as MBP, heart rate, CBV, HbD, transcutaneous PCO2 and PO2 at different timepoints
- Cerebral ultrasound findings are reported in both tables

Key differences:
- The extracted table is missing many rows compared to the baseline table, especially for the cerebral ultrasound findings. Many rows have blank frequency values.
- The extracted table combines the dopamine and epinephrine data into one "Vasopressor Therapy" exposure group, while the baseline keeps them separate. This makes it hard to compare the values between the two vasopressors.
- The extracted table reports some additional blood gas and metabolic parameters at baseline that are not in the baseline table.
- The parameter type, value, unit, and summary statistic columns don't always align between the two tables. For example, the extracted table lists the parameter name again in the parameter type column.
- The variation values are reported as standard deviations in the extracted table but the variation type is not specified, while the baseline table consistently reports the variation type.
- P-values are reported for some parameters in the baseline table but not the extracted table.

In summary, while the tables cover the same study, the many missing values and inconsistent formatting of the extracted table make it challenging to map the values between the two tables. I estimate the overall similarity is around 65%, with the differences outweighing the similarities. Significant data cleaning and reformatting of the extracted table would be needed to enable a more direct comparison.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables:

The extracted table contains some similar information to the baseline table, but there are significant differences in structure and content. Key points:

1. The extracted table is missing the Drug name, Analyte, Specimen, Population, Pregnancy stage, and Subject N columns that are present in the baseline table. This is a major difference.

2. The Parameter type, Value, Unit, Summary statistics, Variation value, and Interval type columns are generally aligned between the two tables. However, the extracted table uses "Range" instead of "IQR" for the interval type.

3. The extracted table has additional rows for patient characteristics like age, weight, RACHS-1 score, creatinine, CPB time, etc. that are not present in the baseline table. 

4. The day-by-day measurements for systolic arterial pressure, heart rate, CVP, inotropic score, lactate, serum Na+, urine Na+, serum K+, and urine K+ match between the tables, although the row order differs.

5. The extracted table is missing the P value column for most of the day-by-day measurements compared to the baseline.

6. The Variation value and Interval columns are combined into one in the extracted table (e.g. "68-80"), whereas they are separate in the baseline.

Given the missing columns, extra patient characteristic rows, differences in Interval type naming, and merged Variation/Interval columns, I would estimate the similarity at:

[[55]]

The tables contain some of the same core measurement data, but the structure and additional data differ quite significantly between the baseline and extracted tables. Closer alignment of the columns and row structure would be needed for a higher similarity score.

The tables have some similarities in structure and content, but there are also significant differences:

1. The extracted table is missing the "EEG response - responder" and "EEG response - total responder" rows for CBZ that are present in the baseline table. This accounts for 2 missing rows.

2. The p-values are formatted differently between the tables. In the baseline, they are in a single cell separated by commas. In the extracted table, they are split across multiple rows in the p-value column. 

3. The extracted table adds drug name abbreviations (CBZ, VPA, LEV) that are not present in the baseline.

4. The order of the rows is different between the tables.

5. The extracted table has additional labeling in the "Outcomes" column compared to the baseline (e.g. "Seizure response", "Complete disappearance", etc.)

6. The extracted table is missing the "EEG response - exacerbation" row for CBZ.

7. Some of the percentage values differ slightly between the tables for the same measures.

8. The extracted table specifies the comparisons for the p-values (e.g. LEV vs CBZ) while the baseline does not.

Given the missing rows, differences in p-value formatting, and additional differences noted above, I would assign a similarity score of:

[[65]]

The tables have the same overall structure and much of the same core data, but the differences are substantial enough to significantly reduce the similarity score from 100. The missing rows in particular lead to a sizable reduction.

Similarity Score: [[65]]

Key Differences:
1. The extracted table is missing several rows compared to the baseline table, including data on abortion rates, duration of labor, BP and PR before delivery, and Hb before delivery. This significantly reduces the similarity score.

2. The column names in the extracted table do not exactly match the baseline table. For example, "Characteristic/risk factor" is used instead of separate columns for population, pregnancy stage, etc. This makes it harder to map data to the correct columns.

3. Some data seems to be in the wrong columns in the extracted table. For example, percentage values are put in the "Value" column instead of the "Variability value" column. The "Summary statistics" column contains "meanÂ±SD" which should be split into separate "Summary statistics" and "Variation type" columns.

4. P-values in the extracted table sometimes contain asterisks (e.g. ".000*") which are not present in the baseline table. 

5. Drug names are not explicitly listed in the extracted table - it uses terms like "TXA group" and "Control group" instead of specifying the drug name.

6. Some outcomes are worded differently between the tables, like "No side effect" vs "No Drug side effect during the first 24 h".

In summary, while the extracted table captures some of the key data from the baseline table, differences in data organization, missing rows, and inconsistencies in how data is recorded lead to a significantly reduced similarity score of 65 out of 100. Matching up the data would require careful mapping of columns and rows between the two tables.

Similarity Score: [[20]]

Key Differences:
1. The extracted table contains many additional rows compared to the baseline table (56 vs 2 rows). The extra rows cover different drugs (olanzapine, risperidone), outcomes (weight, height, DASII scores), and patient conditions not present in the baseline.

2. The columns in the extracted table do not match the expected format based on the provided definitions. For example:
   - The "Exposure" column contains drug names instead of specifying primary drug, metabolite, etc. 
   - The "Outcomes" column lists specific outcomes rather than specimen types.
   - Columns for pregnancy stage, subject N, parameter type, value, unit, variation are missing. 
   - Extra columns like "Characteristic/risk factor" and "Statistic" are present.

3. Where the baseline table focuses on frequency of specific outcomes with quetiapine exposure during breastfeeding, the extracted table looks at normal vs abnormal weight, height and development scores for infants exposed to various antipsychotics.

4. Units, summary statistics, and variation measures are inconsistently reported in the extracted table and do not match the baseline format.

5. The extracted table appears to contain data extracted from a study, but it does not follow the expected structure and content of the baseline pharmacokinetic parameters table.

In summary, while both tables relate to infant outcomes after exposure to antipsychotic drugs, the extracted table differs substantially in structure, content and focus compared to the baseline. The low similarity score of 20 reflects these significant differences.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the extracted table and the baseline table:

The extracted table appears to contain data on risk factors for progression of spherical equivalent, while the baseline table contains data on changes in ophthalmic parameters after one year of atropine 0.01% treatment. There is some overlap in the risk factors analyzed (previous year progression, spherical equivalent, axial length, anterior chamber, pupil size), but the extracted table also includes additional factors like age, gender, and iris color that are not present in the baseline table.

The structure of the two tables is quite different. The baseline table has columns for Characteristic/risk factor, Exposure, Outcomes, Statistic, Value, Unit, Variability statistic, Variability value, Interval type, Lower limit, High limit, and P value. In contrast, the extracted table has columns for Characteristic/risk factor, Exposure, Outcomes, Statistic, Value, Unit, Variability statistic, Variability value, Interval type, Interval low, Interval high, and P value. 

The extracted table is missing the Lower limit and High limit columns present in the baseline, and has Interval low and Interval high columns instead. The extracted table also appears to be using "Residual" in the Variability statistic column while the baseline table uses "SD".

In terms of the actual data, only 5 of the 48 rows in the baseline table have corresponding data in the extracted table (the risk factor analysis for spherical equivalent progression). The values for those risk factors are the same between the two tables.

Given the significant differences in table structure and the fact that the majority of the data in the baseline table is not present in the extracted table, I would assess the overall similarity as quite low.

[[20]]

The key differences are:
1. The extracted table is missing many of the rows present in the baseline table
2. The extracted table has additional risk factors (age, gender, iris color) not present in the baseline

4. The extracted table uses "Residual" for variability while the baseline uses "SD"

Similarity Score: [[50]]

Key Differences:
1. The extracted table is missing many rows compared to the baseline table. The baseline table has 60 rows while the extracted table has 68 rows, but many of the rows in the baseline are not present in the extracted table, such as data on gestational age, birth weight, antenatal steroids, cesarean section, etc.

2. The extracted table has additional rows not present in the baseline table, particularly more detailed scores for white matter, cortical gray matter, deep gray matter, and cerebellum.

3. The extracted table uses different terminology in some cases, such as "Exposure to morphine in the first 7 days of life" instead of just "Morphine exposure".

4. Some of the data in the extracted table does not match the column definitions. For example, the "Interval type" column contains values like "Range" which should be in a separate "Variability statistic" column. The "Interval low" and "Interval high" columns are mislabeled as well.

5. The extracted table is missing the "Adjusted relative risk" statistic present in the baseline table.

6. P-values are formatted differently between the tables, with the baseline using inequalities like "<0.001" and the extracted table writing out "0.001".

7. Units of measurement are missing in the extracted table.

In summary, while there is some overlap in the data between the two tables, the numerous missing and extra rows, terminology differences, and data formatting issues result in a relatively low similarity score of 50 out of 100. The extracted table would need significant cleaning and reformatting to closely match the baseline table structure.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the baseline and extracted tables:

The tables have significant differences in structure and content:

1. The columns are completely different between the two tables. The baseline table has columns like Exposure, Outcomes, Statistic, Value, Unit, etc. while the extracted table has columns like Characteristic/risk factor, Statistic, Value, Unit, Variability statistic, Variability value, etc. There is no direct mapping between the columns.

2. The rows contain different types of data. The baseline table seems to be comparing trachomatous inflammation prevalence between azithromycin and placebo groups. The extracted table contains demographic data about children in communities like age distribution, gender distribution, distance to roads/capital, elevation, etc. The data is not comparable.

3. The baseline table uses percent as the unit while the extracted table uses %, km, and m. The summary statistics are also different - the baseline table does not specify any while the extracted table uses mean and standard deviation (SD). 

4. The baseline table provides 95% confidence intervals while the extracted table provides no interval data.

5. There are no clear synonyms or related terms between the two tables to link them.

Given the completely different table structures, incompatible data, and lack of any matching information, I would assess the similarity between these tables as extremely low.

[[10]]

The tables appear to contain data from different studies or contexts that are not directly comparable. Significant changes would be needed to make the tables more similar, such as collecting the same type of data, using consistent units and statistics, and having related columns and rows.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the baseline and extracted tables:

Similarity Score: [[20]]

Key Differences:
1. The extracted table has completely different columns compared to the baseline table. The baseline table has columns like "Drug name", "Analyte", "Specimen", "Population", "Pregnancy stage", "Subject N", "Parameter type", "Value", "Unit", "Summary statistics", "Variation value", "Variation type", "Interval type", "Lower limit", "High limit", and "P value". In contrast, the extracted table has columns like "Characteristic/risk factor", "Exposure", "Outcomes", "Statistic", "Value", "Unit", "Variability statistic", "Variability value", "Interval type", "Interval low", "Interval high", and "P value".

2. The data in the extracted table does not match the column definitions of the baseline table. For example, the "Exposure" column in the extracted table contains drug names, but in the baseline table, there is a separate "Drug name" column. Similarly, the "Outcomes" column in the extracted table contains information that would fit under "Parameter type" in the baseline table.

3. The extracted table is missing several key columns from the baseline table, such as "Analyte", "Specimen", "Pregnancy stage", "Subject N", "Summary statistics", "Lower limit", and "High limit".

4. The data in the extracted table is not structured in the same way as the baseline table. The baseline table has each row representing a specific drug, population, parameter, and value, while the extracted table has a more varied structure with different types of data in each row.

5. There are many more rows in the extracted table (224 rows) compared to the baseline table (48 rows), indicating that the extracted table covers a much broader scope of information.

Given the significant differences in column structure, data organization, and scope between the two tables, the similarity score is very low at 20 out of 100. The extracted table would need to be heavily reformatted and filtered to match the structure and content of the baseline table.

Here is my assessment of the similarity between the extracted table and the baseline table:

The tables have significant differences in structure and content:

1. The columns in the extracted table do not match the expected columns defined for the baseline table. The extracted table is missing key columns like Drug name, Analyte, Specimen, Population, Pregnancy stage, Subject N, Parameter type, Summary statistics, Variation value, Interval type, Lower limit, and High limit. Instead, it contains columns not defined in the baseline like Characteristic/risk factor, Exposure, Outcomes, Statistic, Interval low, and Interval high.

2. The rows in the extracted table contain different types of data compared to what is expected in the baseline table. The extracted table has data on patient characteristics, surgical details, and mortality risk categories, while the baseline table expects pharmacokinetic parameters related to drug concentrations, clearance, AUC, etc. 

3. Several cells in the extracted table are blank or contain 'NaN' values, while the baseline expects numeric or text values in most cells.

4. The extracted table does not contain any drug names, which is a key column in the baseline table.

5. Units of measurement are inconsistent between the two tables. The extracted table uses units like weeks, %, days, kg, min, while the baseline expects units relevant to pharmacokinetic parameters.

Given the substantial differences in table structure, column definitions, and row content between the extracted and baseline tables, with several key columns and expected data elements missing in the extracted table, I would assign a similarity score of:

[[20]]

The extracted table appears to contain data from a different domain (patient characteristics and surgical outcomes) compared to what is expected in the baseline table (pharmacokinetic parameters related to drugs).
