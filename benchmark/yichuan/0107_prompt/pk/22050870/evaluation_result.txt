Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables:

[[{score}]]
[[63]]

Key differences between the baseline and extracted tables:

1. The extracted table is missing many rows compared to the baseline table (42 rows in baseline vs 9 rows in extracted). This significantly reduces the similarity score.

2. The extracted table is missing data in the "Analyte", "Specimen", and "Pregnancy stage" columns for all rows. The baseline table has this data populated.

3. The extracted table does not contain any of the median values that are present in the baseline table.

4. The parameter names in the extracted table contain additional clarifying information in parentheses compared to the baseline table (e.g. "Maximum concentration (Cmax)" vs just "Cmax"). However, the core parameter names match between the tables.

5. The "Summary statistics" column in the extracted table contains variation information (e.g. "Â± SD") which does not follow the column definition. This data should be in the "Variation type" column instead.

6. Units are represented slightly differently between the tables (e.g. "ng/mL" in extracted vs "ng/ml" in baseline, "ng*hr/mL" vs no unit for AUC in baseline). But the underlying units are equivalent.

7. The subject counts are inconsistent between matching parameters in the two tables (e.g. n=63 for some parameters in baseline but n=15 for those same parameters in extracted table).

In summary, while the core drug, parameters, and values show good alignment between the tables, the extracted table is missing a significant amount of data compared to the baseline which greatly reduces the overall similarity. Fixing the noted inconsistencies in the extracted table would improve the similarity score. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
