Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables:

Similarity score: [[50]]

Key differences between the tables:

1. The extracted table is missing data in several columns compared to the baseline table, including Drug name, Analyte, Specimen, Population, and Pregnancy stage. This significantly reduces the similarity score.

2. The extracted table contains additional rows of data not present in the baseline table, such as birth weight, weight at initiation of treatment, plasma creatinine levels, and postnatal age. While relevant, these rows don't have a direct match in the baseline.

3. Rows 8 and 9 in the extracted table have missing values for the Concentration and are not present in the baseline table.

4. Rows 10-15 in the extracted table provide data on subtherapeutic, therapeutic and supra-therapeutic Cavg proportions which are not included in the baseline table.

5. The extracted table uses the term "Cavg" (likely meaning average concentration) while the baseline uses "concentration". These likely refer to the same parameter but the inconsistent terminology reduces similarity.

6. Rows 16-17 in the extracted table match closely with rows 0-1 in the baseline table, containing the same drug name, concentration values, units, summary statistics, intervals and p-values. This is the strongest area of similarity between the tables.

7. The extracted table is missing the "all concentration" data provided in rows 2-3 of the baseline table.

In summary, while there are a couple rows of directly comparable data between the tables, the large amount of missing data columns and additional non-matching rows in the extracted table result in an overall similarity of around 50 compared to the baseline. The tables contain related information but have significant structural and content differences.
