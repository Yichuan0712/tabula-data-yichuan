Let me analyze these tables systematically as a biomedical expert:

1. Initial Column Mapping Analysis:
- Both tables have the same column structure
- The extracted table has standardized formatting (e.g., "Blood" vs "blood", "Pediatric" vs "child") which is acceptable per instruction #7

2. Key Parameter Matching:
Let me match the pharmacokinetic parameters between tables:

Matching parameters found:
- Cmax: 65.1 ng/ml and 45.3 ng/ml (in both tables)
- tmax: 0.5h and 0.42h (in both tables)
- T1/2: 23.7h and 36.9h (in both tables)
- AUC0-∞: 2062.5 and 1843.6 ng/ml·h (in both tables)
- CL: 0.64 L/h (in both tables)
- Vc: 1.67 L/kg (in both tables)
- Vss: 2.59 L/kg (in both tables)

3. Differences Found:
a) Missing Parameters in Extracted Table:
- Bioavailability (89.40% and 100%)
- Ka (9.8 h-1)
- T1/2 absorption (0.035 h)

b) Additional Parameters in Extracted Table:
- Demographic data (Sex, Age, Weight)
- Clinical parameters (Axillary temperature, Hemoglobin, RBC, WBC)

c) Interval Type Discrepancy:
- Baseline table uses "95% CI"
- Extracted table uses "Range" for all intervals

4. Scoring Considerations:
- Core PK parameters match: +70 points
- Missing 3 important PK parameters: -15 points
- Interval type inconsistency: -10 points
- Units and values match exactly for available parameters: +15 points
- Population/specimen terminology standardized but equivalent: no deduction
- All data mapped to correct columns: +10 points
- Extra demographic/clinical data doesn't affect core PK parameter matching: no deduction

Final Similarity Score: [[70]]

The score reflects that while the core pharmacokinetic parameters are present and match exactly, there are missing parameters in the extracted table and a systematic difference in how the intervals are reported. The additional demographic and clinical data in the extracted table doesn't negatively impact the similarity score since our focus is on PK parameters, but the missing bioavailability, Ka, and absorption T1/2 values represent important pharmacokinetic information that reduces the overall similarity score.
