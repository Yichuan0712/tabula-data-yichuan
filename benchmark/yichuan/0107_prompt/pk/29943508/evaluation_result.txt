Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables:

The key differences between the baseline and extracted tables are:

1. The extracted table has some missing or incomplete information in the "Pregnancy stage" column compared to the baseline (rows 0, 1, 4, 5 are blank).

2. The specimen descriptions are more detailed in the extracted table ("Umbilical vein" and "Maternal serum" vs just "blood").

3. The summary statistics descriptions are more verbose in the extracted table ("Arithmetic mean" vs "mean", "Median" vs "median").

4. Row 5 has a value discrepancy in the "Value" column (0.59 in baseline vs 0.590 in extracted).

5. The interval type formatting is inconsistent ("[25th; 75th percentile]" in extracted vs "25th; 75th percentile" in baseline).

However, the key information anchors (Parameter type, Value, Unit, P Value) align well between the two tables. The row contents generally map to the correct column definitions.

Given the missing pregnancy stage information and minor inconsistencies/formatting differences, but overall strong alignment on the key data elements, I would assess the similarity between these two tables as:

[[75]]

The extracted table captures most of the essential information from the baseline, but has some incompleteness and inconsistency that prevents a higher similarity score. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
