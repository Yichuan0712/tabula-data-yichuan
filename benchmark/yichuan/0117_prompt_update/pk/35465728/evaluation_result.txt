Here is my assessment of the similarities and differences between the baseline and extracted tables, focusing on the Parameter type, Value, Unit, and P Value columns as anchors:

Similarities:
- Both tables contain data on vancomycin concentrations in neonates
- Rows 0, 1, 2, 3 in the baseline table match closely with rows 6, 7, 8, 9 respectively in the extracted table for the Parameter type, Value, Unit, and P Value columns
- Both use median summary statistic and report 25th-75th percentile ranges
- Units are the same where reported (mg/L)

Differences: 
- The extracted table is missing the Specimen column data compared to the baseline
- The extracted table has additional rows (0-5, 10-13) that are not present in the baseline table, containing data on birth weight, plasma creatinine, and Cavg/MIC and AUC/MIC ratios
- Rows 10-13 in the extracted table are missing units
- The extracted table uses range for the Interval type instead of 25th-75th percentiles
- The extracted table is missing data for the Population and Pregnancy stage columns

Based on the significant differences, including the missing specimen data, extra parameter types, and missing population/pregnancy stage data in the extracted table compared to the baseline, I would assign a similarity score of:

[[50]]

The score is not higher because although the core vancomycin concentration data is similar between the tables, the extracted table is missing key metadata and contains extra parameters not present in the baseline table. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
