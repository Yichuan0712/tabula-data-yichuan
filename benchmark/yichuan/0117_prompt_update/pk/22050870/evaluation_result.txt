I'll analyze these tables systematically as a biomedical expert:

1. General Structure Analysis:
- Both tables contain data about Lorazepam in pediatric populations
- The extracted table has fewer rows (12) compared to baseline (42)
- Both tables use similar column structures

2. Detailed Comparison:

Matching Elements:
- Drug name and Analyte are consistent (Lorazepam)
- Population is consistent (pediatric)
- Key parameter types match (Cmax, AUC, CL, Vd, T1/2, etc.)
- Values and units are consistent for matching rows
- Variation type (SD) and values match for corresponding entries

Major Differences:
1. Missing Data:
- Extracted table omits median values present in baseline table
- Baseline table has approximately 30 more rows of data
- Extracted table is missing several groups of measurements (e.g., multiple CL measurements with different subject numbers)

2. Format Issues:
- Summary statistics column in extracted table contains "Mean Â± s.d." which includes variation information
- Unit formatting differences (e.g., "hr" vs "h", "mL/min/m^2" vs "ml/min/m3")
- Specimen column is blank in extracted table but filled as "blood" in baseline

3. Data Completeness:
- Interval type, lower limit, and high limit data present in baseline but missing in extracted
- Missing several parameter types and their corresponding measurements

Similarity Score Calculation:
Base score: 100
Deductions:
- Missing median values (-20)
- Missing rows/measurements (-25)
- Summary statistics column format issue (-5)
- Missing interval data (-10)
- Unit formatting inconsistencies (-2)
- Missing specimen information (-3)

Final Similarity Score: [[35]]

The relatively low score primarily reflects:
1. The significant number of missing rows in the extracted table
2. The absence of median values
3. Missing interval data (min-max ranges)
4. Column formatting issues
5. Incomplete data representation across different subject groups
