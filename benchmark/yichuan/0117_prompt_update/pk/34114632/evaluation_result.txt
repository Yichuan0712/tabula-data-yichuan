Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables:

[[70]]

The extracted table has significant similarities to the baseline table, but there are also some notable differences:

1. The extracted table is missing several rows compared to the baseline:
   - Rows 2, 5, 8, 11 with median Cmax, AUC0-12, Ctrough, and Tmax values for n=2 neonates are absent 
   - Rows 1, 4, 7, 10 with mean Cmax, AUC0-12, Ctrough, and Tmax values for n=9 neonates are absent
   - This accounts for 8 out of 18 total rows missing, which significantly reduces the similarity score

2. The extracted table has "Postpartum" listed under Pregnancy stage for some rows, while the baseline has this blank for all rows. However, the Population is the same (Neonate).

3. The extracted table uses different capitalization and symbols in some places (e.g. "Blood" vs "blood", "AUC0–12" vs "AUC0-12", "µg/mL" vs "ug/mL"). But the meaning is the same.

4. The extracted table is missing the Variation value column that is present in the baseline.

5. The extracted table uses "Range" under Interval type while the baseline uses "minmax". But these likely refer to the same concept.

6. Rows 4-9 in the extracted table combining Pregnancy stage, Subject N, and P value data align with Rows 12-17 in the baseline table. The Parameter type, Value, and Unit data points match.

7. Rows 0-3 in the extracted table partially align with Rows 0, 3, 6, 9 in the baseline in terms of Parameter type. But the Subject N, Summary statistics, and Interval type data is different or missing.

In summary, while there is substantial overlap in the core pharmacokinetic parameters reported between the two tables, the missing rows, different cohort sizes, and some inconsistent statistic types in the extracted table make it only partially match the baseline table structure and data. I estimate a similarity of around 70% when comprehensively considering the differences noted above. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
