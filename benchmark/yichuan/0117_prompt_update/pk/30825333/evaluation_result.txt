Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two tables:

[[83]]

The two tables are overall quite similar, with most of the key information matching between them. The drug name (Ketamine), analyte (Ketamine), parameter types, values, units, summary statistics (mean), variation types (SD), and variation values align between the baseline and extracted tables.

A few minor differences to note:
- The extracted table has an additional "Population" column populated with "Pediatric", while the baseline table has this information in a "Population" column with the value "child". These refer to the same concept.
- The specimen is listed as "blood" in the baseline table and "Plasma" in the extracted table. These are very closely related but not identical. 
- The extracted table has an additional "Pregnancy stage" column populated with "N/A". This column is absent in the baseline table.
- The extracted table has unpopulated "Interval type", "Lower limit", "High limit", and "P value" columns that are not present in the baseline table.
- Some parameter names have minor differences in capitalization and spacing (e.g. "Body weight normalizedclearance" vs "Body weight normalized clearance").

I deducted points for:
- The specimen discrepancy between "blood" and "Plasma" 
- The additional unpopulated columns in the extracted table
- The different representation of the pediatric population between the tables

However, the core data aligning the drugs, parameters, values, units and summary statistics matches very well between the tables. Therefore I assign an overall similarity score of 83 out of 100. The tables are not identical but do contain the same key information with only relatively minor differences in representation.
