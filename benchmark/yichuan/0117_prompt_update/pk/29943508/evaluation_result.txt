Here is my assessment of the similarity between the baseline and extracted tables:

[[76]]

The two tables have a fairly high degree of similarity, with most of the key information matching between them. However, there are a few differences that prevent a perfect 100 score:

1. The "Specimen" column differs in rows 0-1, using "Umbilical vein" in the extracted table instead of just "blood". However, these are referring to the same specimen type.

2. The "Pregnancy stage" column is blank in the extracted table rows 0-1 and 4-5, while the baseline has "post-partum". This missing information lowers the score.

3. The "Interval type" column uses square brackets in the extracted table, e.g. "[25th; 75th percentile]" instead of just "25th; 75th percentile". The meaning is the same though.

4. The extracted table uses "IQR" in the "Variation type" column for rows 2-3 where the baseline table is blank. IQR likely stands for "interquartile range" and corresponds to the 25th-75th percentile values, so this is additional useful information.

5. Some column headers differ slightly, like "Mean serum fentanyl concentration" vs just "concentration,umbilical vein". However the core meaning is the same.

6. Capitalization and spacing formatting differs between the tables in some cells.

Overall, the extracted table captures the vast majority of the information from the baseline, with just minor differences in some cell values and additional detail in a few areas. The core drug, analyte, values, units and statistics match well. But the missing pregnancy stage information and slight variations in the specimen and interval type columns do reduce the similarity score to 76 out of 100.
