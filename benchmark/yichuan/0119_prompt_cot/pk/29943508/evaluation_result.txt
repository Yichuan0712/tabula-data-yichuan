Here are the key differences between the baseline and extracted tables:

1. In the "Parameter type" column, the extracted table is missing commas after "concentration" in rows 0 and 1. This impacts readability but not the core information.

2. The extracted table has extra spaces after commas in many cells. While this doesn't affect the data itself, it reduces consistency compared to the baseline.

3. In the "Variation value" and "Interval type" columns, the extracted table has some empty cells where the baseline has ",,". However, per the instructions, blank/empty cells are treated the same as NaNs so this is not a substantive difference. 

4. The data types, units, and core values all match between the two tables. The data also appears to be mapped to the correct columns based on the provided definitions.

5. The row and column orders match exactly between the tables.

6. No synonyms were found in key columns like specimen, drug name, or population. The tables use consistent terminology.

Overall, while there are some minor formatting and punctuation differences, the core scientific data and structure of the tables is virtually identical. The parameter type, values, units, p-values, and overall table structure all match.

Given the extremely high degree of matching on the most important data elements, I would assess the similarity of these tables as:

[[95]]

The 5 point deduction accounts for the minor inconsistencies in commas and cell spacing, but the tables are substantively the same.
