Here is my assessment of the similarity between the baseline and extracted tables:

Similarity Score: [[72]]

Key Differences:
1. The extracted table is missing rows 26-30 from the baseline table which contain important transplacental distribution and collection time information. This significantly reduces the similarity score.

2. The extracted table is missing the "Pregnancy Stage" column which is present in the baseline table. All cells in this column are blank in the extracted table.

3. Some of the units are slightly different between the two tables:
- In the baseline table, units like "h-1" are written with a hyphen, while in the extracted table they use a minus sign like "h−1" 
- The extracted table uses parentheses in some units like "(ng h)/ml" while the baseline does not
- The extracted table uses the Greek letters α and β while the baseline table uses "a" and "?"

4. The "Variation Type" column in the extracted table is always "95% CI" while the baseline table leaves this column blank and puts "95% CI" in the "Interval Type" column instead. 

5. The extracted table leaves the "Variation Value" column blank while the baseline table has blank cells in the "Variation Type" column. This doesn't match the expected column definitions.

6. The row ordering differs between the tables.

Overall, while much of the core pharmacokinetic parameter data matches between the tables, the missing rows, missing column, and mismatches in where certain metadata is located between the columns results in a similarity score of 72 out of 100. The extracted table is missing some key information compared to the baseline.
