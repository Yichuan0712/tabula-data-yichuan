Here is my assessment of the similarity between the baseline and extracted tables:

Similarities:
- Both tables contain data on levetiracetam pharmacokinetics in neonates, with the same basic parameters reported (Cmax, AUC, Ctrough, Tmax)
- Units are identical between tables for each parameter 
- Summary statistics and variation measures align between tables for the same parameters
- P-values match between tables when reported

Differences:
- Extracted table is missing several rows compared to baseline:
    - Rows with N=9 and N=2 subjects are not present in extracted table
    - Median Tmax value for N=2 also missing
- Extracted table has additional "Pregnancy stage" column populated with "post-natal", which is not present in baseline 
- Some slight differences in notation (e.g. AUC0-12 vs AUC0–12, ug/mL vs µg/mL)
- Extracted table is missing some values, reported as blanks, compared to baseline (e.g. Tmax values, some variation values)
- Subject N values do not exactly align between tables

Based on the significant number of missing rows in the extracted table compared to the baseline, as well as the missing values for certain parameters, I would assess the overall similarity as:

[[65]]

The core data on the PK parameters is quite consistent between the tables, but the missing rows and values in the extracted table reduces the similarity substantially from a score of 100. Specifying the pregnancy stage in the extracted table does not impact the similarity much since this is additional information. The slight differences in notation also have minimal impact on the assessed similarity.
