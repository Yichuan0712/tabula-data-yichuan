Let me analyze these tables systematically as a biomedical expert:

1. Core Data Analysis:
- First 4 rows of both tables match exactly (with minor formatting differences) in terms of:
  - Parameter type (initial/Initial concentration = Initial Cavg concentration)
  - Values (12.9, 20.3, 13.1, 19.8)
  - Units (mg/L)
  - P values (<0.001)
  - Subject N (60, 59, 116, 103)

2. Notable Differences:
a) Row Count:
- Baseline table: 4 rows
- Extracted table: 8 rows
- Additional 4 rows in extracted table contain different parameters (Cavg/MIC ratio, AUC/MIC ratio)

b) Minor Text Variations (considered synonyms):
- Population: "neonates" vs "neonate"
- Parameter type: "initial concentration" vs "Initial Cavg concentration"
- Interval type: "25th-75th percentiles" vs "25th; 75th percentile"

c) Data Mapping:
- All data is correctly mapped to appropriate columns according to definitions
- Column types are consistent with their definitions

3. Similarity Assessment:
- Perfect match for first 4 rows (with acceptable synonym variations): +80 points
- Deductions:
  - Missing 4 rows in baseline (-20 points)
  - This is significant as these rows contain important pharmacokinetic parameters (Cavg/MIC and AUC/MIC ratios)

Final Similarity Score: [[60]]

Explanation:
The first 4 rows show very high similarity with only minor formatting differences that don't affect the data interpretation. However, the extracted table contains 4 additional rows with important pharmacokinetic parameters that are not present in the baseline table. This represents a significant difference in the completeness of the data, which is crucial for biomedical analysis. The missing rows contain different types of measurements (ratios) that provide additional information about drug exposure and efficacy, which are important for clinical interpretation.
