Here is my assessment of the similarities and differences between the two tables:

Similarities:
- Both tables contain data on ketamine pharmacokinetic parameters in blood specimens from pediatric populations 
- The drug name, analyte, specimen type, parameter types, values, units, summary statistics (mean), variation types (SD), and variation values are consistent between the two tables
- The parameters covered include concentration, AUC, Cmax, clearance, mean residence time, volume of distribution, and half-life

Differences: 
- The extracted table has an additional "Population" column specifying "pediatric", while the baseline table just has "child" in some of the rows
- The extracted table is missing data for the "Subject N" column 
- Some parameter names are slightly different between the tables:
  - "Total area under curve" vs "Total area under curve" 
  - "Body weight normalizedclearance" vs "Body weight normalized clearance"
  - "Distribution volumeat steady state" vs "Distribution volume at steady state"
  - "Body weight normalizeddistribution volume" vs "Body weight normalized distribution volume"
- The extracted table uses the μ symbol for µg/L while the baseline does not
- The extracted table columns are in a different order than the baseline
- The extracted table has more empty cells for Interval Type, Lower/High Limits and P-value

Based on the high degree of overlap in the core pharmacokinetic data between the tables, but accounting for some missing data and inconsistencies in the extracted table, I would assess the similarity as:

[[78]]

The extracted table captures the key PK parameters and data from the baseline table, but is missing some metadata and has some formatting and naming differences that prevent a higher similarity score. Ensuring the extracted data is mapped to the appropriate columns and filling in missing cells where possible would improve the score.
