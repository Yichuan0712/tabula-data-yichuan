Here is my assessment of the similarity between the two biomedical tables:

Key differences:
1. The extracted table contains data on two additional drugs (rifampicin and pyrazinamide) that are not present in the baseline table. The baseline table only has data on isoniazid.

2. The Summary statistics column in the extracted table contains "geometric mean" values, while the baseline table contains "median" values. This is an important difference in the type of summary statistic used.

3. The Interval type column in the extracted table contains "range" for all rows, while the baseline table contains "IQR" (interquartile range). Range and IQR are different measures of variability.

4. The extracted table is missing Variation type and Variation value data that is present in the baseline table. 

5. The units for the AUC0-24 parameter are inconsistent between the two tables. The baseline table uses "mg h/L" while the extracted table uses "hâˆ™mg/L".

6. The Subject N values for the CSF specimens differ between the two tables. The baseline table has 20 and 12 subjects, while the extracted table has smaller numbers like 6, 4, 7 and 3.

Similarities:
The tables contain identical values for the isoniazid drug in the Parameter type, Value, P value, Lower limit and High limit columns.

Overall similarity score:
[[30]]

The presence of the extra drugs and rows in the extracted table, the use of different summary statistics and variability measures, the missing variation data, and the inconsistent subject numbers for CSF samples make the tables quite different overall. Only a subset of the isoniazid data is consistent between the two. Therefore, I rate the similarity as only 30 out of 100.
