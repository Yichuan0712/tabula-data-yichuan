Explicit Section Headers: \n  - If the table contains distinct section headers—separate rows labeling groups of data (e.g., 'Group A' vs. 'Group B')—extract and return them as a list of strings.  \n2. Logical Grouping by Column Headers: \n  - If there are no explicit section headers, but the column headers inherently define distinct groups of data (e.g., 'Male / Female' or 'Treatment A / Treatment B'), return those column headers as a list of strings.  \n  - Important: If the column headers are just variable names (e.g., 'Height,' 'Weight'), they do not indicate a logical grouping.\n3. No Identifiable Grouping: \n  - If the table lacks both explicit section headers and column-based logical groupings, return False.\n  - Note: Summary rows (such as means or confidence intervals) do not count as section headers and should not influence classification.\n\nEnsure that the approach is adaptable to different table formats. The determination should be based on whether the primary structure of the table groups data more clearly by rows or by columns.  \n\nFor TABLE_NAME, return one of the following:  \n  - A python list of sections if they exist.   \n  - 'False' if no clear grouping is present.\n",

Only output table in compact json format without any other characters, no space, no newline, no triple backticks ``` and no 'json'.\n2. If the information that is not provided, please leave it with empty string.\n3. The fields 'Analyte' (Ana), 'Specimen' (Sp), and 'Population' (Pop) must always be filled. If not explicitly mentioned in the source, they must be inferred based on other sections of the table and its caption. Do not leave these fields empty.\n4. The fields 'Variation value' (VV) and 'Variation type' (VT) are limited to explicitly listed values in the table and must not be derived from other numbers (e.g., confidence intervals, standard deviation, etc.). If not provided, leave it blank.\n5. You must thoroughly verify to ensure that all interval data in the table is included and extract the lower and upper bounds, placing them into 'Lower Limit' (LL) and 'High Limit' (HL). The 'Value' (V) or 'Variation value' (VV) fields are not meant for intervals.\n6. Ensure all rows are extracted with every possible SN value, retrieving SN from other relevant tables if not explicitly stated in TABLE_SECTION_NAME, and focus only on TABLE_SECTION_NAME.\n\nExamples:\nExample Input 1:\nThis study evaluated lorazepam pharmacokinetics in children with status epilepticus. \n            | Free Fraction\n------------------------|--------\nN            | 61\nRange          | 0.07–0.48\nMean ± s.d.      | 0.10 ± 0.05\nMedian          | 0.09\nExample Output 1:\n[\n  {\"DN\":\"Lorazepam\",\"Ana\":\"Lorazepam\",\"Sp\":\"Blood\",\"Pop\":\"Pediatric\",\"PS\":\"\",\"SN\":\"61\",\"PT\":\"Free fraction\",\"V\":\"0.10\",\"U\":\"\",\"SS\":\"Mean\",\"VV\":\"0.05\",\"VT\":\"SD\",\"IT\":\"Min-Max Range\",\"LL\":\"0.07\",\"HL\":\"0.48\",\"PV\":\"\"},\n  {\"DN\":\"Lorazepam\",\"Ana\":\"Lorazepam\",\"Sp\":\"Blood\",\"Pop\":\"Pediatric\",\"PS\":\"\",\"SN\":\"61\",\"PT\":\"\",\"V\":\"0.09\",\"U\":\"\",\"SS\":\"Median\",\"VV\":\"\",\"VT\":\"\",\"IT\":\"\",\"LL\":\"\",\"HL\":\"\",\"PV\":\"\"}\n]\n\nExample Input 2:\nThis study evaluated lorazepam pharmacokinetics in children with status epilepticus. \n            | Vdss(L/kg)\n------------------------|--------\nN            | 16\nRange          | 1.00–1.54\nMean ± s.d.      | 1.27 ± 0.17\nExample Output 2:\n[\n  {\"DN\":\"Lorazepam\",\"Ana\":\"Lorazepam\",\"Sp\":\"Blood\",\"Pop\":\"Pediatric\",\"PS\":\"\",\"SN\":\"16\",\"PT\":\"Vdss\",\"V\":\"1.27\",\"U\":\"L/kg\",\"SS\":\"Mean\",\"VV\":\"0.17\",\"VT\":\"SD\",\"IT\":\"Min-Max Range\",\"LL\":\"1.00\",\"HL\":\"1.54\",\"PV\":\"\"}\n]\n",
